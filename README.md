**Password Strength Checker**
This repository contains a Python project for evaluating the strength of user-provided passwords based on specific conditions.

**Features**
1. Ensures password meets industry-standard security requirements.
2. Validates the following conditions for a strong password:
3. Minimum 8 characters.
4. Contains at least one digit.
5. Includes at least one uppercase letter.
6. Includes at least one lowercase letter.
7. Contains at least one special character (e.g., !, @, #, etc.).

**How It Works**
1. The program prompts the user to enter a password.
2. It evaluates the password against predefined conditions.
3. It returns one of the following results based on the evaluation:
4. Weak: The password does not meet one or more critical requirements.
5. Medium: The password lacks a special character but meets other criteria.
6. Strong: The password satisfies all conditions.
7. Users can exit the tool by typing 'exit'.
